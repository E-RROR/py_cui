A **py**thon library for creating **c**ommand line **u**ser **i**nterfaces.

### What is py_cui?

`py_cui` is a python library meant to simplify writing command line user interfaces in python. It relies on the `curses` module, which is traditionally a unix-specific python module, however, I was able to use the [windows-curses](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/windows-curses) module to run `py_cui` on windows.

The main advantage `py_cui` has over traditional command line user interfaces is that it relies on widgets and a grid layout manager like most traditional Graphical User Interfaces. You may define a grid size, and then drop predefined widgets onto it into specific grid locations. Widgets can also be stretched accross multiple grid rows and columns. If you've ever made a Tkinter GUI, you will feel right at home.

### Writing a PyCUI

Basic usage of `py_cui` starts with creating a PyCUI object, and specifiying it's grid size. Keep in mind that grid cell height and width will be measured in terminal characters, not pixels, so there is a lower limit on legal grid size, and heights will be smaller values than widths. Create this object with:
```
root = py_cui.PyCUI(7, 9)
```
The above line will create a UI with 7 rows and 9 columns. Then, add widgets with the different add commands:
```
label = root.add_label('Label Text', 0, 0)
button = root.add_button('Button Text', 1, 2, column_span=2, command=my_function)
...
```

Finally, start the CUI with
```
root.start()
```

`py_cui` has support for custom key bindings for both the overview mode and focused mode, popup windows and prompts, color rendering rules, and several useful widgets. For more details on writing `py_cui` based interfaces, be sure to check on the examples and the documentation [here](https://jwlodek.github.io/py_cui-docs).

### Using a PyCUI

There are some basic rules that apply to all `py_cui` based interfaces. There are three key operating modes - overview mode, focus mode, and popup mode. 

**Overview Mode**

Overview mode is the main control view of the interface. In this mode you use the arrow keys to move between widgets, and you may select widgets with the `Enter` key. By default, you may also press buttons in this mode, unless `auto_focus_buttons` is set to false when the CUI was created.

**Focus Mode**

When in focus mode, you enter into a particular widget (For example a text box.). Each widget has some predefined basic controls, such as arrow keys to scroll in a `ScrollMenu`. You may also add keybindings to functions for each particular widget. These keybindings will only apply to a widget if it is in focus mode. Enter focus mode by navigating to a widget in overview mode and hitting the `Enter` key. Return to overview mode from focus mode by pressing `Escape`.

**Popup Mode**

Popup mode simply displays a popup over the rest of the UI. Each popup type behaves slightly differently. For example, you may exit an info popup mode by pressing `Space`, `Enter`, or `Escape`, while a loading popup will remain onscreen until whatever operation is being run is terminated.
